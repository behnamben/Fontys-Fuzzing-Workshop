# Fuzzing a Command Line Program with Honggfuzz

## Introduction

Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a computer program. The goal is to uncover bugs or security vulnerabilities. This section explains how to use Honggfuzz, a powerful fuzzing tool, to test command line programs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
- The Honggfuzz tool installed on your system. You can obtain it from [Honggfuzz's GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz).

## Detailed Compilation Instructions with Different Sanitizers

To maximize the effectiveness of Honggfuzz, it's recommended to compile your program with specific sanitizers. These sanitizers help detect various kinds of bugs and undefined behaviors at runtime. Here's how to compile your program with different sanitizers:

### Address Sanitizer (ASAN)

- **Purpose:** Detects memory errors such as buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities.
- **Compilation:** Use the `-fsanitize=address` flag with your compiler. For example:

```bash
hfuzz-clang -fsanitize=address -o my_program my_program.c
```

### Memory Sanitizer (MSAN)

- **Purpose:** Identifies uninitialized memory reads, which can lead to unpredictable behaviors.
- **Compilation:** Utilize the `-fsanitize=memory` flag. Note that all libraries your program uses must also be compiled with MSAN to avoid false positives.
- **Example:**

```bash
hfuzz-clang -fsanitize=memory -o my_program my_program.c
```

### Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN)

- **Purpose:** Catches undefined behaviors in C/C++ code, such as division by zero, null pointer dereference, and more.
- **Compilation:** Include the `-fsanitize=undefined` flag during compilation.
- **Example:**

```bash
hfuzz-clang -fsanitize=undefined -o my_program my_program.c
```

When using these sanitizers, replace `hfuzz-clang` with `hfuzz-gcc` if you are using GCC. The compilation flags for sanitizers are generally the same between GCC and Clang.

## Preparing the Input Corpus (Seeds)

An effective fuzzing campaign starts with a good set of seed files. If you don't have initial seeds, consider the following approaches:

- Use minimal valid inputs that your program can process.
- Look for sample inputs in the program's documentation or test suites.
- Generate random inputs using tools like `dd` or scripting languages.
- Diversify your seed collection to improve the fuzzing coverage.

## Running Honggfuzz

With your program compiled for instrumentation and your input corpus ready, you can now run Honggfuzz:

```bash
honggfuzz -i hfuzz_inputs -- your_program ___FILE___
```

## Monitoring and Analyzing Results

Honggfuzz will run indefinitely, saving any inputs that cause crashes for further analysis. Regularly review these inputs and the corresponding crashes to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Fuzzing with Honggfuzz and the appropriate sanitizers enhances the security and stability of your command line programs by uncovering and allowing you to fix potential vulnerabilities.
